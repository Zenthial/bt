[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
        [] crashes when?
        [] infinite loop when it should not?
        [] only works in printed mode?
        [X] work fine?
        [] only implemented these options: [please list them]
        [] other? Explain.


How does your move strategy work? Describe briefly in English.

My move strategy loops through all the available vacant points, picks the first one from the top left and proceeds down from there.
It is the first vacant location strategy.

============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?


The simulation had a very similar end outputs to the Conway game of life. 
Both have outputs that end with repeating end state, where every cycle would just go back and forth until the program ended.


============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

I learned how to use getopt and ncurses successfully. I also got more experience with pointers and passing pointers between functions.


What was easy about this assignment?

Randomizing the array was pretty easy, as there are 2D array random assignments demonstrated in earlier code samples.


What gave you problems or troubles?

Calculating the happiness was the hardest part, mostly due to my incompetence trying to balance a coordinate system.
I always seem to overthink how 2D matrix coordinates work, when I really should just run a nested for loop and pass the two variables to every function

What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

I would have appreciated a bit more explanation on the how the teams' happiness measure was calculated, as I'm not sure if I did it correctly.
I would have also appreciated more specific options restrictions. 
For instance, the fact that percentages can only be from 1-99 instead of 0-100 would have been good to write down on the actual project writeup

What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

Seeing as we learned about dynamic memory weeks ago, I would have liked to have talked this with dynamic memory allocation.
